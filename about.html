    <p>August 31 2020, is the day four beings got lucky.
      Emmanuel and Ruby had lost their furbaby of 14 years a few months prior.
      Ruby decided to ask a coworker if they by chance had any bulldogs for adoption,
      as that was Emmanuel's dream dog.Her coworker told her they had two bulldogs available.
      A mom and her pup, mom was 3 years old, her pup was a year old. Ruby and Emmanuel have an apartment so they were
      hesitant to take both bulldogs,
      so she asked if they would be able to adopt just the boy.</p>

    <p>
      Life had other plans. As soon as they walked through the door of the foster home,
      they were divided and conquered. Brando (formerly JR) jumped on his new dad and
      claimed him. They wrestled on the floor and played like a bunch of kids. Harley
      (formerly Abby) jumped on the couch next to Ruby and wouldn’t stop cuddling her.
      It was exactly what they needed.
      The cute little old ladies fostering them kept trying to convince Ruby and
      Emmanuel to take them both. When it came time to grab the leash, Harley and
      Brando both ran and sat eagerly awaiting their time to go. Ruby and Emmanuel
      looked at each other and knew they couldn’t leave her.
    </p>

    <p>
      That night they went to Target for supplies, to meet their new grandma's, then home
      sweet home. They've been spoiled rotten ever since. They know what a Barkbox is and
      whine for it to be opened when it comes in the mail. Harley openly complains when
      Brando hogs the bed or steals all the blankets. Harley Quinn guards her new hoomans
      and her new home as though they were her's the whole time. Brando Beau is the biggest
      baby and still acts like a puppy. He flops himself onto you thinking he's puppy
      size at almost 50 pounds... in their eyes he is and always will be.
